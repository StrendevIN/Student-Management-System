Install the required Python packages:

```sh

##  Create Executable Application

**With Terminal Window:**
```sh
python -m PyInstaller app.py --onefile
```

**Without Terminal Window:**  
*(If you want a GUI-only app, use `.pyw` extension)*

```sh
python -m PyInstaller app.pyw --onefile
```

Rename your main file to `app.pyw` to avoid launching a terminal window.
